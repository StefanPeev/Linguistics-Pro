Then the TeX Users Group (TUG) gave all such rights, irrevocably and in perpetuity, to any and all interested parties (cf. http://tug.org/fonts/utopia/LICENSE-utopia.txt).  The Utopia Nova fonts are a modified version of the Heuristica font family (http://code.google.com/p/evristika), which was last released by Andrey V. Panov in 2014 in accordance with the conditions of the Adobe/TUG license agreement.  The Heuristica fonts in turn contains glyphs from the Vntopia font family (http://vntex.sf.net), which was released by Han The Thanh in 2006 also in accordance with the conditions of the Adobe/TUG license agreement.  The Linguistics Pro font family is a modified version of the Utopia Nova font family (http://andreas.nolda.org/software.html), which was released by Andreas Nolda in 2015 under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) – http://scripts.sil.org/ofl. The Utopia Nova OpenType and Web Open fonts (version 1.12) are a modified version of the Heuristica font family, which in turn is based on the Utopia Type 1 fonts, designed by Robert Slimbach for Adobe and licensed to the TeX Users Group (TUG) for free modification and redistribution. Those Unicode fonts are particularly useful for documents in linguistics, as they include IPA characters as well as many spacing or combining diacritics. In addition, they support various typographic features such as ligatures, proportional figures, etc.; a stylistic set provides longer slashes, matching the parenthesis in height. The Linguistics Pro font family contains two models of cyrillic glyphs. The base range of the cyrillic glyphs (uni0410:uni044F) represents the modern Bulgarian letterform model. The traditional cyrillic letterform model is included as a local feature for Russian language and as a Stylistic Set 01. Compare to Utopia Nova the encoding in the Linguistics Pro font family is completely rearranged, there are changes in the form of some glyphs and new glyphs are added.",
  "body": "### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
