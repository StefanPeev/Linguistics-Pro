# Linguistics Pro
**Linguistics Pro** is a part of the project **LOCAL FONTS** for development of <code>free-to-use fonts</code> with the *modern Bulgarian letterform model* in the Cyrillic Unicode range. The project as a whole is based on well known fonts published under licenses which permit modifications and derivative works.
The Linguistics Pro font family is based on the Utopia Nova font family, issued by Andreas Nolda, copyright(c) 2015, under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL), version 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/ofl). On 2016-10-08 Andreas Nolda renamed his font "Utopia Nova" to "Lingua Franca", for licensing reasons. "Utopia Nova" no longer exists. See the [ChangeLog.txt in "Lingua Franca"](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/lingua-franca) for more information, the Nolda's [website](http://andreas.nolda.org/software.html) and [documentation](/documentation/).

The Linguistics Pro font family contains two models of Cyrillic glyphs. The base range of the Cyrillic glyphs <code>(uni0410:uni044F)</code> represents the modern Bulgarian letterform model. The traditional Cyrillic letterform model is included as a local feature for Russian language and as a Stylistic Set 01. In the future the project will be develop as a multilingual font for Latin and for Cyrillic scripts with a special attention to local features in OpenType.
