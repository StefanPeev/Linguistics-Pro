# Linguistics Pro
**Linguistics Pro** is a part of the project **LOCAL FONTS** for development of <code>free-to-use fonts</code> with the *modern Bulgarian letterform model* in the Cyrillic Unicode range. The project as a whole is based on an existing fonts under licenses which permit modifications and derivative works. An other font in this project is [**Cova**l](https://github.com/StefanPeev/coval).
The Linguistics Pro font family is based on the Utopia Nova font family, issued by Andreas Nolda, copyright(c) 2015, under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL), version 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/ofl). On 2016-10-08 Andreas Nolda renamed his font "Utopia Nova" to "Lingua Franca", for licensing reasons. "Utopia Nova" no longer exists. See the [ChangeLog.txt in "Lingua Franca"](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/lingua-franca) for more information, the Nolda's [website](http://andreas.nolda.org/software.html) and [documentation](/documentation/).

The Linguistics Pro font family contains two models of Cyrillic glyphs. The base range of the Cyrillic glyphs <code>(uni0410:uni044F)</code> represents the modern Bulgarian letterform model. The traditional Cyrillic letterform model is included as a local feature for Russian language and as a Stylistic Set 01. In the future the project will be develop as a multilingual font for Latin and for Cyrillic scripts with a special attention to local features in OpenType.
