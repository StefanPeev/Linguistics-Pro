        <h1>Linguistics-pro</h1>
        <p>The Linguistics Pro font family is based on the Utopia Nova font family, issued by Andreas Nolda, copyright(c) 2015, under the SIL Open Font License (OFL), version 1.1; see at http://scripts.sil.org/ofl.  The Utopia Nova font family is based on the Adobe Utopia fonts, which were licensed by Adobe to the TeX Users Group (TUG) under the following license:  Adobe Systems Incorporated (&quot;Adobe&quot;) hereby grants to the TeX Users Group and its members a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to the typeface software for the Utopia Regular, Utopia Italic, Utopia Bold and Utopia bold Italic typefaces, including Adobe Type 1 font programs for each style (collectively, the &quot;Software&quot;) as set forth below.  Adobe grants the TeX Users Group a license under its copyrights, to use, reproduce, display and distribute the Software for any purpose and without fee provided that the following copyright notice appears in all whole and partial copies of the Software and provided that the following trademark symbol and attribution appear in all unmodified copies of the Software:    Copyright 1989, 1991 Adobe Systems Incorporated. All rights reserved.   (alternatively, @1989, 1991 Adobe Systems Incorporated. All rights reserved.)   Utopia(R)   Utopia is either a registered trademark or trademark of Adobe Systems   Incorporated in the United States and/or other countries. Used under license.  Adobe also grants to the TeX Users Group a license to modify the Software for any purpose and redistribute such modifications, for any purpose and royalty-free, provided that the modified Software shall not use the font name(s) or trademark(s), in whole or in part, unless explicit written permission is granted by Adobe. This restriction applies to all references stored in the Software for identification purposes, such as the font menu name and other font description fields. The TeX Users Group is also permitted to sublicense, and grant such sublicensees the right to further sublicense, any or all the foregoing rights through multiple tiers of distribution. The licenses granted herein are granted in perpetuity and may not be terminated by either party unless such termination is based on a breach of the terms and conditions herein stated.  Adobe retains ownership of the copyright in the Software. The TeX Users Group agrees that Adobe and its suppliers are the sole and exclusive owners of all rights, title and interest, including all copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights in the Software.

Then the TeX Users Group (TUG) gave all such rights, irrevocably and in perpetuity, to any and all interested parties (cf. http://tug.org/fonts/utopia/LICENSE-utopia.txt).  The Utopia Nova fonts are a modified version of the Heuristica font family (http://code.google.com/p/evristika), which was last released by Andrey V. Panov in 2014 in accordance with the conditions of the Adobe/TUG license agreement.  The Heuristica fonts in turn contains glyphs from the Vntopia font family (http://vntex.sf.net), which was released by Han The Thanh in 2006 also in accordance with the conditions of the Adobe/TUG license agreement.  The Linguistics Pro font family is a modified version of the Utopia Nova font family (http://andreas.nolda.org/software.html), which was released by Andreas Nolda in 2015 under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) – http://scripts.sil.org/ofl. The Utopia Nova OpenType and Web Open fonts (version 1.12) are a modified version of the Heuristica font family, which in turn is based on the Utopia Type 1 fonts, designed by Robert Slimbach for Adobe and licensed to the TeX Users Group (TUG) for free modification and redistribution. Those Unicode fonts are particularly useful for documents in linguistics, as they include IPA characters as well as many spacing or combining diacritics. In addition, they support various typographic features such as ligatures, proportional figures, etc.; a stylistic set provides longer slashes, matching the parenthesis in height. The Linguistics Pro font family contains two models of cyrillic glyphs. The base range of the cyrillic glyphs (uni0410:uni044F) represents the modern Bulgarian letterform model. The traditional cyrillic letterform model is included as a local feature for Russian language and as a Stylistic Set 01. Compare to Utopia Nova the encoding in the Linguistics Pro font family is completely rearranged, there are changes in the form of some glyphs and new glyphs are added.</p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
